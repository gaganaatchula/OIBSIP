1. Landing Page:
Description:A landing page is the first webpage that visitors see when they arrive at your site. It serves as a gateway to other pages and often contains key information about your project or personal brand. In our example, we'll design a clean and visually appealing landing page using HTML and CSS.

2. Portfolio:
Description:A portfolio showcases your work, projects, and achievements. It provides visitors with an overview of your skills and experience. Using HTML to structure the content, CSS to style it, and perhaps some JavaScript for interactivity, we'll create a dynamic and professional portfolio to highlight your accomplishments.

3. Temperature Converter:
Description:A temperature converter is a simple utility that allows users to convert temperatures between different units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit). This will be implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic of the converter.
